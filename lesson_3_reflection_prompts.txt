When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working w/ other people. Want other people to review changes. Open source. Backup work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If in the middle of making changes, don't want to have to deal with 'merge' issues until you're done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone is copy of repository. Branch is a thread. Fork is a copy of someone's repos where you have full history w/o causing changes to theirs
